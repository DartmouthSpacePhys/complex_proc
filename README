This is a copy of complex_proc that I found lying about somewhere or other. It is used as part of the LaBelle group's code suite for processing data on the fly and making it available for cp_rtd, John Hughes' code that we soon hope to make legacy.

For example, let's say you were using the South Pole setup with QuickUSB acquisition stuff. These instructions are from Matt Broughton:

#################################

1. In one of the terminals, type sudo /usr/src/qusb_acq/qusb_acq -P rxdsp-south_pole -o /daq/ -d 0.5 -p 1,2 
This will start the acquisition
2. In the second terminal, type sudo  /usr/src/complex_proc/cprtd -f 350 -F 680
3. In the third terminal, type cd /usr/src/rtdgui/
Then type sudo /usr/src/rtdgui/rtdgui hf2_config.input

#################################

Perhaps you can infer that complex_proc/cprtd has the responsibility of getting things ready for rtdgui to actually display data real-time. Know what I'm saying?
